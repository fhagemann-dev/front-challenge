# DE Take Home Assignment

## Objective

Design a data pipeline to pull the weather information, store, and analyze the result. This assignment will test your programming skills and the ability to interact with external systems using API endpoints. Please make sure your code is robust, maintainable, and well-documented.

---

## Dataset

Using the [National Weather public](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api#/default/obs_stations) endpoint, we can read the weather data from various locations (stations). Below are the relevant APIs for this exercise:

1. Available stations can be found using the `/stations` endpoint.
2. Weather observations at a station can be fetched using the `/observations` endpoint.

Other technical details can be found in the websiteâ€™s **Specifications** tab.

## Tasks

1. **Pick your favorite programming language and database** for this exercise.
2. Write a data pipeline to get weather information for a **single station** of your choice.
   - Sample station IDs: `0112W`, `0128W`.
3. Load the data into the database table(s). The database must store at least the following data points:
   - Station ID
   - Station name
   - Station timezone
   - Latitude/Longitude
   - Observation timestamp
   - Temperature (rounded to two decimal places)
   - Wind Speed (rounded to two decimal places)
   - Humidity (rounded to two decimal places)
4. Use the stored data and write SQL statements for the following metrics:
   - Average observed temperature for the last week (Mon-Sun).
   - Maximum wind speed change between two consecutive observations in the last 7 days.

## Pipeline Specifications

1. Process the last 7-days data into the database table(s) when running the pipeline for the first time. Consequent runs must insert only the new records.
2. Re-running the pipeline multiple times must not result in duplicate records in the table.
3. Feel free to assume other details as required. Document your assumptions.

## Deliverables

A GitHub repository or a zip file containing:
- Source code and database script files.
- Any configuration files or instructions needed to run your code.

---

## Evaluation Criteria

- **Functionality**: Does the solution correctly ingest, transform, and analyze the data as required?
- **Error handling**: Does the code handle errors gracefully?
- **Efficiency**: Are the ingestion and transformation processes optimized for performance?
- **Code Quality**: Is the code clean, well-organized, and documented? Are best practices followed?
- **Documentation**: Is the documentation clear and comprehensive?
